# Quizzr

A simple trivia app for the web.

It's powered by React (+ TypeScript) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), one of the components library that I like the most!

You can check the full stack opening [package.json](./package.json)

## Features

### Do it in your time

This is a persistent game: you can continue where you left off!
Try it out: start a quiz and then navigate to the home page. You'll find the option to continue with the current quiz!

### Answer slider

After you complete a trivia, there's a nice cool slider in the right hand side of the home screen -- or as the background if you're on mobile!
